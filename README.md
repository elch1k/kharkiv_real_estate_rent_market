# Little project to understand rental real estate market in ukrainian city Kharkiv
**Resouce:** I parsed data from one of the largest real estate sites in Ukraine - [DimRia](https://dimriagroup.com).

In this project I used combination of asynchronous parsing and Selenium-based parsing to scrape the necessary data for next [EDA](https://github.com/elch1k/kharkiv_real_estate_rent_market/blob/main/rent_real_estate_project.ipynb)
